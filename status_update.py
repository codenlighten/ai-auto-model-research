🧠 AI RESEARCH ORGANIZATION - STATUS UPDATE
================================================================================

📊 CURRENT PERFORMANCE:
   - Total Experiments: 12
   - Success Rate: 33.3% (4/12)
   - Best Rating: 5/10
   - Average Rating: 4.0/10
   - Breakthroughs (≥7/10): 0
   - Gap to Breakthrough: 2.0 points

🔧 RECENT IMPROVEMENTS:
   ✅ Fixed Unicode encoding errors (UTF-8 with error='replace')
   ✅ Added 3 focused experiments (pruning_analysis, learning_rate_discovery, architecture_depth_study)
   ✅ Added INSIGHTS requirement - agents must provide:
      - Key Finding (breakthrough discovery)
      - Practical Recommendation (actionable advice)
      - Surprising Result (unexpected patterns)
      - Future Direction (next steps)

🎯 CURRENT EXPERIMENT:
   - Name: pruning_analysis
   - Status: Running (Phase 1: Discussion)
   - Expected Quality: 7+/10 (designed for breakthrough)
   - Key Features:
     * Systematic testing (7 pruning ratios)
     * Complete metrics (accuracy, size, inference time)
     * Publication-quality results
     * Required insights section

💡 WHY THIS MATTERS:
   The insights requirement forces agents to:
   1. Analyze patterns in the data
   2. Draw meaningful conclusions
   3. Provide practical value
   4. Think beyond raw metrics
   
   This should push quality from 5/10 → 7+/10 by demonstrating:
   - Deep understanding of results
   - Scientific reasoning
   - Actionable recommendations
   - Novel discoveries

🚀 NEXT STEPS:
   1. Complete pruning_analysis experiment
   2. Validate insights quality
   3. If ≥7/10: Trigger amplification system
   4. Generate 6-perspective impact package
   5. Demonstrate full end-to-end capability
